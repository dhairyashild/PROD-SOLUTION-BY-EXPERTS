80 % of DevOps candidates stumble on these 13 core topics in interviews.
Maybe you’re one of them.

Learn them - and you’ll stop being “just another DevOps engineer” and start sounding like someone who’s run real systems at scale.

→ 1. IaC Drift & State Management
- Terraform isn’t magic — state is.
- Pitfall: editing infra manually = drift, destroy failure, and team chaos.
- How to practice: terraform import a live resource, break it, run plan and explain the diff.

→ 2. CI/CD Pipelines
- Build, test, deploy — sounds easy until half your stages run on shared runners.
- Typical Q: “How do you ensure one bad pipeline doesn’t block all others?”
- How to practice: create a GitHub Actions matrix build with caching and concurrency control.

→ 3. Secrets Management
- Secrets don’t belong in Git repos - not even private ones. At least, use .env files
- Pitfall: Kubernetes Secrets are base64-encoded, not encrypted. Anyone with RBAC read access can see them.
How to practice:
- Enable envelope encryption with KMS in Kubernetes (encryptionConfiguration on API server) and Secrets Manager to store secrets combined with externalSecrets operator.
- Integrate Vault or SOPS for secret encryption/decryption.
- Rotate and revoke dynamically — don’t rely on static AWS keys.

→ 4. Kubernetes Networking
- If you can’t explain ClusterIP vs NodePort, you’re not ready.
- Interview Q: “Pod A can’t reach Pod B — how do you debug it?”
- How to practice: deploy a pod, run tcpdump, traceroute, and kubectl exec into it.

→ 5. Observability
- Logs tell stories, metrics tell trends, traces tell truth.
- Pitfall: no cardinality control = OOM Prometheus.
- How to practice: deploy Prometheus + Grafana, add custom app metrics, break something, alert on it.

→ 6. Scaling & Auto-Healing
- “It scales automatically” — until your pod keeps CrashLooping.
- How to practice: set HPA on CPU and memory, simulate load with hey, watch scaling curve.

→ 7. Networking & Load Balancing
- NGINX, Traefik, or ALB — same goals, different trade-offs.
- Pitfall: health checks that lie = half your cluster dark.
- How to practice: configure readiness vs liveness probes, misconfigure one, observe downtime.

→ 8. Disaster Recovery
- Backups don’t matter until restore works.
- Interview Q: “How would you test DR in prod?”
- How to practice: snapshot an RDS, delete data, restore to a clone, verify checksum parity.

→ 9. Immutable Infrastructure
- Snowflake servers kill consistency.
- Pitfall: patching live EC2s instead of redeploying AMIs.
- How to practice: bake AMIs with Packer, deploy via Terraform, tear down daily.

→ 10. Container Security

- root in Docker ≠ root on host — but it’s close enough to burn you.
- How to practice: run Trivy scan, fix CVEs, add non-root user to Dockerfile.
