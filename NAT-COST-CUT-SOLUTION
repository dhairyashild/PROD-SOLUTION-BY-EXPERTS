Our NAT Gateway cost more than the rest of our infra.
$3,885/month. Just for routing traffic. 

How we found it:

→ AWS bill jumped from $12k → $17k
→ Traced line by line
→ NAT Gateway alone: $4,800/month

Why?

→ 89 TB/month through 3 NAT Gateways
→ Microservices calling external APIs
→ Docker image pulls
→ Build-time downloads
→ S3 uploads, CloudWatch logs

What we fixed:

VPC Endpoints
— Added S3 + DynamoDB Gateway
— Saved 34 TB/month

ECR instead of Docker Hub
— Pulled images internally
— Saved 22 TB/month

Consolidated API Calls
— Batching + caching
— Cut external traffic 60%

Fewer NAT Gateways
— 3 → 1 (only 1 in prod)
— Saved $720/month on hourly cost

Now:
→ 15 TB traffic
→ $915/month total
→ Savings: $3,885/month
→ $46,620/year 

Data transfer is expensive.
On some level VPC Endpoints are free.
Don’t wait for a huge bill to audit yours.
